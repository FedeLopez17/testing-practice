# Testing practice

This is an [assignment from The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice#assignment).<br>
It consisted of a series of small exercises which I had to solve using a [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) workflow, and it was my first proper introduction to test runners, Jest specifically.<br>

## Functions written:
 - `capitalize`.
 - `reverseString`.
 - `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply` methods for a calculator object.
 - `caesarCipher`.
 - `analyzeArray`.
